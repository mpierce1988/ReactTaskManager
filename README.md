# Task Manager

Welcome to Task Manager, a React-based task management application designed to showcase web development skills, focusing on creating dynamic and robust user interfaces.

## Live Demo
The application is hosted on Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://dulcet-bublanina-bd3479.netlify.app/tasks).

## Features

### React Hooks
This project extensively utilizes React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects in functional components. I also created a custom hook - useUser - which holds the user's ID.

### User Registration and Login
Users can register and log in to access personalized task management experiences.

### CRUD Functionality
The application offers intuitive Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for task management.

### Test-Driven Development
The development of this project followed the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Unit tests were created for components before implementing the components themselves.

### Backend
The initial mock backend was created using NodeJS and was later ported over to Django. The Django backend is hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
